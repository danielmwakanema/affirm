  An optimist believes that we live in the best world. A pessimist is afraid that it might be true.
  We can't help everyone but everyone can help someone.
  It's just a bad day not a bad life.
  Learn from yesterday live for today and have hope for tomorrow.
  Dont be afraid to stand for what you believe in even if that means standing alone.
  Improve your memory by doing unforgettable things.
  Don't let your worries get the best of you; remember Moses started out as a basket case.
  If you're still looking for that one person who will change your life take a look in the mirror.
  The road to success is always under construction.
  You are worth it.
  Life is what you make of it.
  Look up to the sky you’ll never find rainbows if you’re looking down.
  To be loved be lovable.
  Not knowing when the dawn will come I open every door.
  Silence has many beauties.
  Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.
  I exist as I am that is enough.
  My path is not thy path yet together we walk hand in hand.
  The sun is new every day.
  Love is not consolation it is light.
  Life is too short to be little.
  Courage is found in unlikely places.
  You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
  I exist as I am that is enough.
  He who would eat the kernel must crack the shell.
  He who sows virtue reaps glory.
  Live each day as if your life had just begun.
  Love is my religion I could die for that.
  Men are born to succeed not to fail.
  I have to put up with two or three caterpillars if I want to know butterflies.
  There is always something left to love.
  Every day you play with the light of the universe.
  I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free.
  He whose face gives no light shall never become a star.
  Where a man can live he can also live well.
  It is wisdom to believe the heart.
  Let no one who loves be unhappy even love unreturned has its rainbow.
  The only lasting beauty is the beauty of the heart.
  Somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known.
  No one has ever become poor by giving.
  Dream manfully and nobly and thy dreams shall be prophets.
  The burden which is well borne becomes light.
  Your life is worth much more than gold.
  This world is but a canvas for our imagination.
  A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
  It is what opposes that helps.
  Heraclitus (Quoted by Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics)
  Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.
  My path is not thy path yet together we walk hand in hand.
  Nothing can dim the light which shines from within.
  The human soul needs actual beauty more than bread.
